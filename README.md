# Web Server and DNS Records Vulnerabilities Checker PowerShell Scripts

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This repository contains PowerShell scripts to check for common vulnerabilities in web servers such as Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), Apache, and Nginx. Additionally, there is a `dns-vuln-check` script to scan DNS records for vulnerabilities. These scripts help identify potential security weaknesses in your web server configurations and DNS records, and provide information about discovered issues along with related Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and suggested fixes.

## Features

### Common Features for IIS, Apache, and Nginx Scripts:

- **SSL Certificate Validation**: The scripts include a custom SSL validation callback that allows them to ignore self-signed certificates during the scan.

- **Security Headers Check**: The scripts analyze HTTP response headers to identify missing security headers such as `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `Content-Security-Policy`. They provide information about missing headers, their related CVEs, and suggested fixes.

- **Insecure Cookies Detection**: The scripts check for insecure cookies by inspecting the `Set-Cookie` headers. They identify cookies that are missing the `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, or `SameSite` attributes.

- **Web Server and Framework Version Check**: The scripts extract information about the web server and framework versions. They provide information about the detected versions and advise on the removal of sensitive headers.

- **TLS Version Check**: The scripts check the supported TLS versions and alert if insecure TLS versions (TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1) are detected.

- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirect Check**: The scripts check whether the domain redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS, helping ensure secure communication.

- **Scoring System**: The scripts assign scores to each security check and calculate a total score, providing an overall assessment of the server's security.

- **PDF Export**: You can export the scan results to a PDF file for documentation and sharing.

### Script-Specific Features:

#### `iis-vuln-check.ps1` (for IIS)

- Additional IIS-specific checks and recommendations.

#### `apache-vuln-check.ps1` (for Apache)

- Additional Apache-specific checks and recommendations.

#### `nginx-vuln-check.ps1` (for Nginx)

- Additional Nginx-specific checks and recommendations.

### DNS Records Vulnerabilities Checker:

- The `dns-vuln-check.ps1` script allows you to scan domain DNS records for vulnerabilities.

- It checks for missing or incorrect DNS records, such as missing PTR records, and provides related CVEs and suggested fixes.

## Prerequisites

- PowerShell installed on your system.
- Appropriate permissions to run the scripts against the target server.

## Usage

### Running the Web Server Scripts:

1. Open a PowerShell terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired script (`iis-vuln-check.ps1`, `apache-vuln-check.ps1`, or `nginx-vuln-check.ps1`).

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```powershell
   .\script-name.ps1
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the domain to check.

Review the scan results to identify vulnerabilities, related CVEs, and suggested fixes.

Implement recommended solutions and best practices to improve server security.

Running the DNS Records Script:
Open a PowerShell terminal.

Navigate to the directory containing the dns-vuln-check.ps1 script.

Run the script by executing the following command:


Copy code
.\dns-vuln-check.ps1
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the domain to check.

Review the scan results to identify DNS record vulnerabilities, related CVEs, and suggested fixes.

Implement recommended DNS record configurations to enhance security.

Example Usage:
powershell
Copy code
# Run the IIS vulnerabilities checker script
.\iis-vuln-check.ps1

# Run the Apache vulnerabilities checker script
.\apache-vuln-check.ps1

# Run the Nginx vulnerabilities checker script
.\nginx-vuln-check.ps1

# Run the DNS records vulnerabilities checker script
.\dns-vuln-check.ps1
Exporting Results to PDF:
After running the web server or DNS records script, you will be prompted to export the results to a PDF file.

Enter the PDF file path to save the results (e.g., C:\Path\To\Results.pdf).

The script will generate a PDF report summarizing the vulnerabilities, related CVEs, suggested fixes, and a score calculation.
