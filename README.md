# IIS Vulnerabilities Checker PowerShell Script

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This PowerShell script, `iis-vuln-check.ps1`, is designed to check for common vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). It helps identify potential security weaknesses in your IIS server configuration and provides information about discovered issues along with related Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

## Features

- **SSL Certificate Validation**: The script includes a custom SSL validation callback that allows it to ignore self-signed certificates during the scan.

- **Security Headers Check**: The script analyzes HTTP response headers to identify missing security headers such as `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `Content-Security-Policy`. It provides information about missing headers and their related CVEs.

- **Insecure Cookies Detection**: The script checks for insecure cookies by inspecting the `Set-Cookie` headers. It identifies cookies that are missing the `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, or `SameSite` attributes.

- **IIS and ASP.NET Version Check**: The script extracts information about the IIS version, ASP.NET version, and the `X-Powered-By` header. It advises on the removal of sensitive headers.

- **TLS Version Check**: The script checks the supported TLS versions and alerts if insecure TLS versions (TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1) are detected.

- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirect Check**: The script checks whether the domain redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS, helping ensure secure communication.

- **Scoring System**: The script assigns scores to each security check and calculates a total score, providing an overall assessment of the server's security.

- **PDF Export**: You can export the scan results to a PDF file for documentation and sharing.

## Prerequisites

- PowerShell installed on your system.
- Appropriate permissions to run the script against the target server.

## Usage

1. Open a PowerShell terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory containing `IIS-vuln.ps1`.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```powershell
   .\IIS-vuln.ps1
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the domain to check.

Review the scan results to identify vulnerabilities and their related CVEs.

Implement recommended solutions and best practices to improve server security.
